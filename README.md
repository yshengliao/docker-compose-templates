# Docker Compose Templates

[English](README.md) | [ÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá](README.hant.md)

---

Welcome to my Docker Compose template repository! üéâ This is where I store all the handy scripts I use to spin up services quickly. Whether you need a simple development setup or something more sophisticated, this collection has you covered. Think of it as a toolbox‚Äîgrab what you need and launch! üöÄ

## Docker Guide

To get started with these templates, make sure you have Docker installed. You can follow the installation instructions on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Docker Compose is a powerful tool that simplifies managing multiple containers locally.

Once you‚Äôre set up, use the following command in any folder containing a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

When you‚Äôre finished, you can shut down all the containers with:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

That‚Äôs all it takes! üöÄ

## Directory Structure

- `docker-compose.yml`: The default template for a quick start.
- Subdirectories: Specialized setups for specific environments or services.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yshengliao/docker-compose-templates.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the template you want:

   ```bash
   cd docker-compose-templates/<template-directory>
   ```

3. Launch the services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Docker Compose Version Notice

As of newer versions of Docker Compose, the `version` attribute in the `docker-compose.yml` file is no longer required. I‚Äôve removed it from all templates in this repository to ensure compatibility with the latest versions and reduce confusion.
