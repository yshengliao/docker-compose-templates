    <!-- 
    Configure ClickHouse to listen on all available network interfaces, 
    including both IPv6 (::) and IPv4 (0.0.0.0). 
    This is necessary to allow connections from both other containers in the Docker network 
    as well as external hosts.

    <listen_host>::</listen_host>  <!-- Listen on all IPv6 addresses -->
    <listen_host>0.0.0.0</listen_host>  <!-- Listen on all IPv4 addresses -->

    <!-- 
    This setting allows the server to continue running even if either IPv4 or IPv6 network 
    is not available (for example, in certain containerized environments). 
    When set to 1, it tries to listen on available networks and skips those that are unavailable.

    Uncomment the following section if you want to enable console logging.
    This is useful for debugging purposes when running ClickHouse in Docker, 
    as logs can be output directly to the container logs.
